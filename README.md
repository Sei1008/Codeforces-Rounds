# Competitive-Programming-Solutions
# 🏆 Codeforces Solutions

This repository is a collection of my solutions to problems encountered during various **Codeforces** contests and practice sessions.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is two-fold:

1.  **Personal Archive:** To maintain a personal, version-controlled archive of all my competitive programming submissions and accepted solutions.
2.  **Sharing & Learning:** To share my approach and solutions with the community for peer review and mutual learning.

---

## 📁 Organization (Structure)

Solutions are typically written in **C++** (or other languages as noted) and are organized primarily by **Problem ID** (the Codeforces identifier) for quick reference.

* Each file is named using the **exact Problem ID** (usually including the Round number and problem letter).
    * **Examples:** `2044A.cpp`, `1800B.cpp`, `1900C.cpp`.
* This structure allows me to quickly search and track my progress on specific problems.

Feel free to browse, review the code, and suggest improvements!
